Hello!
The Martians need your help. They are in contact with the H5N1 virus.
We know that there is a universal vaccine (locus HW306977) on our planet. Find the substances on their planet that can be used to synthesize the vaccine. A large sample database is at your disposal.
mars_dna_samples.zip.
Your task is to select the right combination of samples (recipe). Result is the shortest (lowest count of samples used to synthesize the vaccine). If you find more than one shortest recipe - select the one, which has the longest code in each sample from start to end.
Example:
Code: 123456
Samples (id,code):
1,4
2,6
3,12
4,34
5,56
6,45
7,123
Available combinations
12-34-56
123-45-6
123-4-56
Solving: 123 + 45 + 6
Result: 7,6,2
